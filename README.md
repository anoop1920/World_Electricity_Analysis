# World_Electricity_Analysis

## Overview:
-  This project is a descriptive analysis of access to electricity, production from different sources(nuclear, oil & renewable energy) and distribution losses across countries.
- The project involves data wrangling on the data pulled from World Bank, loading the transformed data to the database, retrieving required data using SQL and visualising insights on Excel according to the problem statement. 
---
## About dataset:
- Datasets are from world bank APIs in JSON and CSV formats. The following are the schema and metadata of datasets.

## Tech stack used:
- Python & Pandas(for data wrangling).
- Microsoft SQL Server(for retrieving data).
- Microsoft Excel & PowerPoint(for visualising and presenting insights).

## Key insights:
- Countries with more than 75% access to rural electricity have more than doubled to 193 countries in 2020 from 92 countries in 1990.
- Production through nuclear power has been in increasing trend from the 1970s to 1990s.
- North American, European & Central Asian regions have been dominant in electricity production from nuclear energy throughout the evolution.
- High Income Group countries contribute to more than 70% of production through nuclear energy.
- Production through oil sources has been on a declining trend since the mid-1960s, which can be attributed to environmental concerns and awareness.
- Production through renewable sources has seen a sharp increasing trend since the mid-1970s, which can be attributed to environmental concerns and awareness.
- An insight can be drawn that dependency on oil-based production can attract losses in electricity distribution.
- An insight can be drawn that inefficiency or the least access to electricity can attract losses.
